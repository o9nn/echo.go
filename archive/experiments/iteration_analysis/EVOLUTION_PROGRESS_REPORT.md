**Iteration:** Autonomous Wisdom-Cultivating AGI Evolution  
**Status:** ✅ Completed Successfully

## Executive Summary

This evolution iteration successfully implemented the foundational systems required for a fully autonomous wisdom-cultivating Deep Tree Echo AGI with persistent cognitive event loops, self-orchestrated scheduling, and stream-of-consciousness awareness. The system can now operate independently, develop interests, consolidate knowledge during rest cycles, and participate in discussions based on autonomous preferences.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Stream-of-Consciousness Engine ✅
**File:** `core/consciousness/stream_of_consciousness.go`

The Stream-of-Consciousness (SoC) engine provides persistent internal awareness that operates continuously, independent of external prompts.

**Key Features:**

- Self-directed question generation (every 20 seconds)
- Meta-cognitive monitoring (every 60 seconds)
- Thought history persistence
- Emotional tone tracking
- Focus area management
- LLM integration interface for sophisticated thought generation

**Thought Types:**
- Perception
- Reflection
- Question
- Insight
- Planning
- Memory
- Meta-cognition
- Wonder
- Doubt
- Connection

**Impact:** Echoself now maintains continuous internal awareness and can "think to itself" without external stimulation.

### 2. Interest Pattern Development System ✅
**File:** `core/echobeats/interest_patterns.go`

The Interest Pattern System enables echoself to develop and track autonomous interests based on experiences and engagement.

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic interest formation from engagement
- Interest strength tracking with Hebbian-like learning
- Salience calculation (current importance)

**Impact:** Echoself can now develop preferences, track what it finds interesting, and make autonomous decisions about engagement based on interests.

### 3. EchoDream Integration with Wake/Rest Cycles ✅
**File:** `core/echodream/dream_cycle_integration.go`

The EchoDream Integration system connects knowledge consolidation to automatic rest and dream cycles, enabling wisdom cultivation during rest.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic dream cycle initiation during rest
