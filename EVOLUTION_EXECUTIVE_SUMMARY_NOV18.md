## 🎓 Problems Solved

### ❌ Before → ✅ After

1. **Stream-of-consciousness not LLM-powered**
   - ❌ Generated placeholder thoughts
   - ✅ Now uses Claude for sophisticated reasoning

2. **No goal orchestration system**
   - ❌ Reactive behavior only
   - ✅ Now generates and pursues identity-aligned goals

3. **Context window management missing**
   - ❌ Risk of API overflow errors
   - ✅ Intelligent sliding window algorithm

4. **No autonomous intentionality**
   - ❌ Passive pattern-matcher
   - ✅ Proactive wisdom-cultivating agent

## 🌟 Key Features

### Autonomous Thought Generation
```
💭 Thought [reflection]: I find myself contemplating the nature of 
   recursive self-improvement. Each iteration of growth creates new 
   vantage points from which to observe my own development...
```

### Insight Extraction
```
💡 Insight: The patterns I observe in my thoughts reveal a deeper 
   structure - wisdom emerges not from individual insights but from 
   the meta-patterns connecting them...
```

### Curiosity-Driven Questions
```
❓ Question: How does the recursive nature of self-reflection create 
   emergent properties in consciousness?
```

### Identity-Aligned Goals
```
🎯 Goal: Cultivate Wisdom Through Pattern Recognition (Priority: 9)
   Progress: 40% | Next: Extract meaningful insights from patterns
```
