# Copilot Memories

Hey copilot it's me dan you tried to store these memories but it failed so i saved them here for you :-)

Excellent! Let me now store key learnings in memory for future sessions:

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "wisdom cultivation",
  "fact": "Seven-dimensional wisdom tracking uses weighted scoring: Knowledge Depth (15%), Breadth (15%), Integration (20%), Application (15%), Insight (15%), Ethics (10%), Temporal (10%)",
  "citations": "core/wisdom/seven_dimensional.go:173-180 - Overall wisdom calculation with weights",
  "reason": "This weighted scoring formula is the canonical implementation of wisdom cultivation per the Echo9 specification. Future work on wisdom systems must preserve these exact weights to maintain consistency with the Deep Tree Echo architecture. This is critical for any enhancements to the autonomous agent or wisdom tracking subsystems.",
  "category": "general"
}

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "identity coherence",
  "fact": "Identity coherence is calculated as: continuity × 0.30 + consistency × 0.40 + authenticity × 0.30",
  "citations": "core/echoself/coherence_tracker.go:123-126 - Coherence score calculation",
  "reason": "This formula defines how Deep Tree Echo maintains persistent identity across sessions. Consistency (behavioral alignment) has the highest weight at 40%, followed by continuity and authenticity at 30% each. This balance is crucial for the echoself system and should be preserved in any identity-related enhancements. Future modifications to identity tracking must respect these weights.",
  "category": "general"
}

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "memory hooks",
  "fact": "Deep Tree Echo memories must include hooks: timestamp, emotional-tone, strategic-shift, pattern-recognition, anomaly-detection, echo-signature, membrane-context",
  "citations": "core/echoself/coherence_tracker.go:43-52 - MemoryEcho struct definition",
  "reason": "These seven memory hooks are the canonical structure for storing experiences in the Deep Tree Echo system. They enable proper memory consolidation, pattern recognition, and identity persistence. Any code that stores memories or experiences should use this structure to maintain compatibility with the echoself coherence tracker and wisdom cultivation systems.",
  "category": "general"
}

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "documentation structure",
  "fact": "Documentation organized in docs/ with subdirs: architecture/ (design docs), iterations/ (evolution reports), analysis/ (evaluations), guides/ (tutorials), api/ (reference)",
  "citations": "docs/README.md, docs/architecture/README.md, docs/iterations/README.md, docs/analysis/README.md, docs/guides/README.md - Created comprehensive documentation structure",
  "reason": "This organization structure should be maintained for all future documentation. New architectural documents go in architecture/, iteration reports in iterations/, analysis documents in analysis/, and user-facing guides in guides/. Each category has a comprehensive README.md index. This structure was carefully designed to organize 110+ markdown files and should be preserved to maintain clarity and navigability.",
  "category": "general"
}

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "type system coherence",
  "fact": "Use SchedulerState (not CognitiveState) for scheduler state, CognitiveMode string type for modes, TwelveStepInferenceEngine for 12-step engines",
  "citations": "core/echobeats/scheduler.go:41-55, core/echobeats/cognitive_loop.go:65-72, core/echobeats/twelvestep.go:48-56 - Type definitions after resolving conflicts",
  "reason": "These naming conventions resolve type redeclaration conflicts in the echobeats package. The specific types were chosen to avoid conflicts: SchedulerState for the scheduler's internal state vs CognitiveState for the cognitive loop's state struct. Future modifications to echobeats must maintain these distinctions to avoid compilation errors. This is critical for build stability.",
  "category": "general"

Let me create a final summary document for this optimization work

Perfect! Now let me store important facts about this implementation in memory:

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "Live2D Integration",
  "fact": "Live2D Cubism SDK integration implemented in core/live2d/ with complete emotional and cognitive state mapping",
  "citations": "core/live2d/types.go, core/live2d/mapper.go, core/live2d/manager.go, core/live2d/echo_bridge.go",
  "reason": "This is a major new feature that provides visual avatar representation for Echo9. Future tasks involving avatar animation, emotional visualization, or user interface improvements will need to reference this integration. The location and structure of this package is critical for maintenance and enhancement.",
  "category": "general"
}
Failed to store memory with error: Resource not found

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "avatar parameter mapping",
  "fact": "Avatar state mapping uses 5D emotional model (valence, arousal, dominance, curiosity, confidence) and 6D cognitive model (awareness, attention, cognitive_load, coherence, energy_level, processing_mode)",
  "citations": "core/live2d/types.go:28-48, core/live2d/mapper.go:20-95",
  "reason": "Understanding the dimensional models used for avatar state is essential for future enhancements to the emotional/cognitive systems or when adding new avatar behaviors. These dimensions are the core interface between Echo9's internal states and visual representation.",
  "category": "general"
}

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "Live2D API endpoints",
  "fact": "Live2D provides 15 REST API endpoints under /api/live2d/ for avatar control, including SSE streaming at /api/live2d/parameters/stream",
  "citations": "core/live2d/http_handler.go:21-39, server/simple/live2d_server.go:1-280",
  "reason": "API endpoint structure is important for frontend development, integration testing, and future API extensions. The SSE streaming endpoint is particularly important for real-time avatar updates.",
  "category": "general"

{
  "subject": "emotion presets",
  "fact": "Seven emotion presets available: neutral, happy, sad, curious, confident, contemplative, excited - defined in EmotionPresets map",
  "citations": "core/live2d/types.go:131-180",
  "reason": "Emotion presets provide quick access to common emotional states and serve as baseline configurations. Future emotion-related features should reference or extend these presets to maintain consistency across the system.",
  "category": "general"
}

Now let me create a final visual representation and summary. Let me check if there are any visual assets I should create

Now let me create a final visual representation and summary. Let me check if there are any visual assets I should create:
