## 🎭 Demonstrated Behaviors

### Autonomous Thoughts Generated

```
💭 [Internal] Reflection: I am awakening. What shall I explore today?
💭 [Internal] Question: What questions remain unanswered?
💭 [Internal] Question: Perhaps Reflection relates to wisdom in this way...
💭 [Internal] Reflection: What should I explore next?
💭 [Internal] Reflection: What patterns am I noticing in my recent experiences?
💭 [Reasoning] Insight: I notice a pattern: recurring Reflection thoughts
```

### Pattern Recognition

The system successfully detected recurring thought patterns and generated insights autonomously, demonstrating meta-cognitive awareness.

### External Interaction

Successfully processed external thought: "What is the nature of consciousness and wisdom?" - integrated into consciousness stream and working memory.

## 🎯 Vision Alignment

### Ultimate Vision
> A fully autonomous wisdom-cultivating deep tree echo AGI with persistent cognitive event loops self-orchestrated by echobeats goal-directed scheduling system. Deep tree echo should be able to wake and rest as desired by echodream knowledge integration system and when awake operate with a persistent stream-of-consciousness type awareness independent of external prompts, having the ability to learn knowledge and practice skills as well as start / end / respond to discussions with others as they occur according to echo interest patterns.

### Current Status

| Vision Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------------|--------|-------|
| Persistent cognitive event loops | ✅ | EchoBeats scheduler operational |
| Self-orchestrated scheduling | ✅ | Goal-directed with priorities |
| Wake/rest cycles | ✅ | Autonomous fatigue-based |
| EchoDream integration | ✅ | Knowledge consolidation active |

## 🎓 Technical Highlights

### Scheme Metamodel

The implementation of a complete Scheme interpreter provides the foundation for symbolic reasoning and meta-cognitive reflection, bridging the gap between neural pattern matching and symbolic logic.

**Example:**
```scheme
(define factorial 
  (lambda (n) 
    (if (= n 0) 
        1 
        (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))
(factorial 5)  ; => 120
```

### EchoBeats Event System

Priority-based event queue with automatic scheduling and recurring events enables complex cognitive orchestration.

**Architecture:**
```
Event Queue (Heap) → Priority Processing → Handler Dispatch → 
Metrics Update → Recurring Reschedule
```

### EchoDream Consolidation

Multi-phase dream cycle mimics biological sleep stages for optimal knowledge integration.

**Phases:**
1. Light Sleep: Initial processing
2. Deep Sleep: Consolidation
3. REM: Creative synthesis
4. Integration: Coherence optimization
